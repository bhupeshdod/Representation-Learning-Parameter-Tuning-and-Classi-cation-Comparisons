# Representation-Learning-Parameter-Tuning-and-Classification-Comparisons

Representation Learning by applying PCA and LDA, Parameter Tuning and classification Comparisons of kNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree with 5 fold cross validation onto Abalone and Wine dataset


The final results are shown in the following tables.


It is evident from the above findings that for both the datasets, maximum accuracy is given by KNN Algorithm when applied on abalone data. The next best accuracy is of Random Forest. The algorithm to produce least accuracy is Naive Bayes be it Complement Naive Bayes or Multinomial Naive Bayes for both the datasets. Out of all the Decision Tree and Decision Tree Ensembles Random Forest has performed the best. Random Forest has emerged to better in performance and in runtime than Gradient Tree Boosting. Random forest has performed the best on Wine data overall. Amongst KNN and Naive Bayes, KNN has performed better on these particular datasets, which indicates that Naive Bayes is not a good choice of algorithm for categorical data.
